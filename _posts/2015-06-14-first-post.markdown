I've been meaning to learn <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> for a while now and I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to play around with it today. For those unfamiliar with Jekyll, it's a static site generator that allows you to easily and quickly create a blog without the use of a database or CMS. 

Jekyll takes markdown (or other raw text) files and runs them through a liquid web renderer to display content. 

So far, I've been very impressed with how simple it was to set up this blog, but I did use the <a href="http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/" target="_blank">Minimal Mistakes</a> template to assist in the layout and design of the site. Hopefully my opinion of the framework stays the same as I continue to build out blog functionalities! 

As of right now, this blog is running locally (which means that at this moment, no one but me can read this post). I do plan to deploy this blog via GitHub Pages and connect it to my <a href="http://davidjsaunders.com" target="_blank">portfolio site</a> eventually though.
